# Tour-Travel Application Server Documentation

Welcome to the **Tour Travel Application**! This application is designed to manage tours, bookings, users, and authentication for a travel agency. It provides a robust backend system built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, read, update, and delete users. Users can have roles like `admin` or `user`.
- **Tour Management**: Manage tours with details like name, duration, price, start dates, and locations.
- **Booking Management**: Handle bookings for tours, including booking status and total price calculation.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure routes with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
- **Email Notifications**: Send emails for password reset and other notifications using **Nodemailer**.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for database operations, validation, and authentication.
- **Pagination, Sorting, and Filtering**: Advanced querying capabilities for tours and bookings.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose for schema modeling)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer
- **Error Handling**: Custom error handlers for MongoDB, Zod, and generic errors
- **Environment Management**: Dotenv for environment variables
- **API Testing**: Postman or any REST client

### Changes Made:
1. Added **Live Deployment Link** under the **Live Deployment** section.
2. Added **GitHub Repository Link** under the **GitHub Repository** section.
3. Both links are clearly labeled and easy to find.

Replace the placeholders (`https://tour-traval.vercel.app/` and `https://github.com/your-username/tour-travel-app`) with your actual deployment and repository URLs. This will make it easy for users to access the live server and explore the codebase.

### Example User Object

````json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "image": "https://example.com/john-doe.jpg",
  "role": "user",

# booking Model Documentation

The `booking` model represents feedback provided by users for specific tours in the Tour-Travel Application. This document provides detailed information about the model's attributes, relationships, and example data structures.

---

## Attributes

The `booking` model contains the following attributes:

- **booking**: The textual feedback provided by the user.
- **ratting**: The rating given by the user (e.g., 5).
- **tour**: A reference to the `Tour` being bookinged (linked by `Tour ID`).
- **user**: A reference to the `User` who wrote the booking (linked by `User ID`).

---

## Relationships

- A `booking` belongs to a single `Tour`.
- A `booking` belongs to a single `User`.
- A `Tour` can have multiple `booking`s.
- A `User` can write multiple `booking`s for different tours.

---

## Database Schema

The schema for the `booking` collection in the database is as follows:

```json
{
  "booking": "string",
  "ratting": "number",
  "tour": "ObjectId", // Reference to the Tour collection
  "user": "ObjectId" // Reference to the User collection
}
